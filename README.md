# Up and Away

[Click here to play the game](https://rachelanna4.github.io/up-and-away/3rtkm). ## Background

Up and Away was the first web app that I built in React.
It is a take on the classic game of 'Hangman' designed with child-friendly user interface in mind.
Users can select from a variety of category which generates a word they need to guess. They must guess the word before Penelope the pig runs out of balloons!
If the user gets stuck, they can access a clue to help them before they run out of lives.
